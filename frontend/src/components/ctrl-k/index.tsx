/*
[selection] Scenario 1:
- Select items in a list of contacts
- Click on Ctrl+K
- A list of actions and keys to modify will be proposed, and filtered by the search input
- Select key "tags"
- We are now in "search" mode for tags, in addition to results we have actions, like "cancel" and "+ Current Query", tags used in all selection appears as "delete XXX"
- Creating a tag  create it and affect it to the selected contacts
- Ctrl+K is closed and list should refresh in the background

[selection] Scenario 2:
- Select items in a list of contacts
- Click on Ctrl+K
- A list of actions and keys to modify will be proposed, and filtered by the search input
- Select key "parents"
- We are now in "search" mode for other contacts, in addition to results we have actions, like "cancel" and "+ Current Query", contacts used in all selection appears as "delete XXX"
- Creating a parent happens in the ctrl+K modal
- When done, we get back to "search" previous path, but with query set to the new parent's label

âœ… [search] Scenario 3:
- Click on Ctrl+K without selection
- A list of entities is proposed, like "contacts", "tags", "invoices", as well as a list of actions (go to invoices etc)
- Search can filter this actions by keyword (ex. "invoice")
- Select "Search Invoices"
- We are now in "search" mode but for entity_type "invoices"
- We can search for invoices, when selecting one, it opens it and close the ctrl+K
